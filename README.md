Copy a protoype into vs code and make it into a functioning website with responsiveness 
Peer reviewed by: Andrew Nilsson - Good job on getting the desktop size setup and looks good. Your responsivness needs some work though. Most things don't scale correctly or many sections just dissapear when you scale down to a tablet or phone size. Also the foot image is not aligned in the center.
